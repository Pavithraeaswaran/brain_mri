### Backend Integration (Ready for Django)
The application is designed to integrate with a Django REST API:

```python
# Expected API Endpoints
POST /api/upload/        # MRI upload and analysis
GET  /api/scans/         # Scan history
GET  /api/scans/{id}/    # Individual scan details
GET  /api/analytics/     # Dashboard analytics
```

## 🧠 AI Model Integration

The application supports PyTorch model integration:

```python
# Expected model structure
class BrainTumorClassifier:
    def predict(self, image_path):
        return {
            "prediction": "Tumor" | "Normal",
            "confidence": float,  # 0.0 - 1.0
            "processing_time": float
        }
```

## 🔒 Security & Compliance

- **Data Privacy**: All uploaded images are processed locally or in secure environments
- **Medical Standards**: Designed with HIPAA compliance considerations
- **Secure Storage**: Files are handled with appropriate security measures
